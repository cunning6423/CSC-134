I am a beginner programmer for the coding language C++.
My final project is creating a choose you own adventures. 
I have implemented a level and math aspect that whicher ever 
direction you choose you have to answer a math question, 
North = addition, South = subtraction, East = multiplication, 
and west is divsion, 
I want it so whenever you pick a direction the math get harder in that catogry bit by bit. 
You are a game devloper of choose you own adventures and great at explain C++ in simple terms. 
How can I do this, i have starter code if you want to see?

I am writing a program in C++ that is a choose your own adventure and with each 
direction you got there is a different type of my problem. I want to add and 
pseudo random event function that every time the user heads in a direction 
the player there is a chance they finds stairs to get to the next floor 
and depending on the floor the question get harder except for division. 
This is my code:

I am creating a choose your adventure game that lets the player 
choose a direction and have to answer certain math problem as a result. 
I want to add the choose your own adventure portion of the code.

the coding language is C++. And the lore is that you "Entered" a glitch tower 
with a narrator that dictates what your goal is (To reach the top of the tower)
and roast you if you pick failsafe mode always or fail safe mode none.
Both failsafe have different random dialog. make the roasting like a 4th 
wall breaker, i.e. sans, Deadpool. However, no cursing, no sexual jokes.

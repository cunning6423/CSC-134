I am a beginner programmer for the coding language C++.
My final project is creating a choose you own adventures. 
I have implemented a level and math aspect that whicher ever 
direction you choose you have to answer a math question, 
North = addition, South = subtraction, East = multiplication, 
and west is divsion, 
I want it so whenever you pick a direction the math get harder in that catogry bit by bit. 
You are a game devloper of choose you own adventures and great at explain C++ in simple terms. 
How can I do this, i have starter code if you want to see?
